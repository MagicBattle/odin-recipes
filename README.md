# odin-recipes 
This is my first project in the HTML Foundations course, testing my skills in Git and the basics of HTML. The project is a minimal website that showcases some recipes. 

This project now displays some basic css to showcase my new learning. 

The next update of the project will now display some more knowledge about css about spacing/borders.
